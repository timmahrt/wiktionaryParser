# wiktionaryParser
High-level parser of wiktionary files

I played around with some of the libraries for reading wikis and had difficulty
getting what I wanted out of wikitionary.

So I'm trying to write a simple one myself.  It's not great but hopefully can
be useful to get the info I want.

This
[mwparserfromhell](https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell)
is a popular library but I got a bunch of parsing issues from it.  Maybe
I should give it another shot.

## Dependencies

[mediawiki_dump](https://github.com/macbre/mediawiki-dump)
`pip install mediawiki_dump`
